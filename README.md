| Approach/Methodology        | The study involves an empirical investigation to understand the effectiveness of LLMs (e.g., GPT 3.5) in detecting fake news compared to SLMs like fine-tuned BERT. The authors designed an adaptive rationale guidance network (ARG) for fake news detection, which allows SLMs to leverage LLM-generated rationales for enhanced analysis. A rationale-free version, ARGD, was also developed for cost-sensitive use cases through distillation. |
| Datasets Used               | N/A                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Results/Performance Metrics | ARG and ARGD outperformed three types of baseline methods, including those based on SLMs, LLMs, and their combinations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Challenges                  | LLMs like GPT 3.5, despite offering desirable multi-perspective rationales, underperform compared to fine-tuned SLMs like BERT due to difficulties in selecting and integrating rationales effectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Key Contribution            | The research highlights that while LLMs alone may not surpass fine-tuned SLMs in fake news detection, they can serve as valuable advisors by providing multi-perspective rationales. The adaptive rationale guidance network (ARG) is a significant contribution that allows SLMs to incorporate LLM insights selectively, along with the cost-effective, rationale-free ARGD variant.                                                             |

| Approach/Methodology            | The paper proposed an entity debiasing framework (ENDEF) that aimed to generalize fake news detection models to future data by mitigating entity bias from a cause-effect perspective. The causal graph among entities, news contents, and news veracity was modeled, and the direct effect of entities was removed during inference to reduce bias.                                                                                               |

| Approach/Methodology            | The paper exploited multiple weak signals from different sources of user engagements with content (referred to as weak social supervision) and their complementary utilities for detecting fake news. It used a meta-learning framework to train a fake news detector by jointly leveraging limited clean data and weak signals, estimating the quality of different weak instances.                                                               |
| Datasets Used                   | Real-world datasets were used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Results/Performance Metrics     | The proposed framework outperformed state-of-the-art baselines for early detection of fake news without using any user engagements during prediction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Challenges                      | State-of-the-art systems faced challenges for early detection due to the rapidly evolving nature of news events and limited annotated data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Key Contribution                | The main contribution was the development of a framework that effectively used weak social supervision and meta-learning for early fake news detection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Approach/Methodology            | The paper verified that dual emotion was distinctive between fake and real news and proposed Dual Emotion Features to represent this dual emotion and their relationship for fake news detection. The proposed features were designed to be compatible with existing fake news detectors for enhancement.                                                                                                                                          |
| Datasets Used                   | Three real-world datasets, one in English and two in Chinese.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Results/Performance Metrics     | The proposed feature set outperformed state-of-the-art emotional features related to the task and improved the performance of existing fake news detectors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Challenges                      | Existing methods focused only on publisher emotions and did not consider the high-arousal emotions evoked in the crowd (social emotions).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Approach/Methodology            | The paper argued that existing models focusing solely on linguistic aspects without fact-checking were prone to misclassify fact-tampering fake news and under-written real news. It highlighted the importance of combining fact-checking with linguistic analysis and proposed a crowdsourced knowledge graph as a preliminary solution for collecting timely facts.                                                                             |
