| Approach/Methodology        | The study involves an empirical investigation to understand the effectiveness of LLMs (e.g., GPT 3.5) in detecting fake news compared to SLMs like fine-tuned BERT. The authors designed an adaptive rationale guidance network (ARG) for fake news detection, which allows SLMs to leverage LLM-generated rationales for enhanced analysis. A rationale-free version, ARGD, was also developed for cost-sensitive use cases through distillation. |
| Datasets Used               | N/A                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Results/Performance Metrics | ARG and ARGD outperformed three types of baseline methods, including those based on SLMs, LLMs, and their combinations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Challenges                  | LLMs like GPT 3.5, despite offering desirable multi-perspective rationales, underperform compared to fine-tuned SLMs like BERT due to difficulties in selecting and integrating rationales effectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Key Contribution            | The research highlights that while LLMs alone may not surpass fine-tuned SLMs in fake news detection, they can serve as valuable advisors by providing multi-perspective rationales. The adaptive rationale guidance network (ARG) is a significant contribution that allows SLMs to incorporate LLM insights selectively, along with the cost-effective, rationale-free ARGD variant.                                                             |

| Approach/Methodology            | The paper exploited multiple weak signals from different sources of user engagements with content (referred to as weak social supervision) and their complementary utilities for detecting fake news. It used a meta-learning framework to train a fake news detector by jointly leveraging limited clean data and weak signals, estimating the quality of different weak instances.                                                               |
| Datasets Used                   | Real-world datasets were used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Results/Performance Metrics     | The proposed framework outperformed state-of-the-art baselines for early detection of fake news without using any user engagements during prediction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Challenges                      | State-of-the-art systems faced challenges for early detection due to the rapidly evolving nature of news events and limited annotated data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Approach/Methodology            | The paper verified that dual emotion was distinctive between fake and real news and proposed Dual Emotion Features to represent this dual emotion and their relationship for fake news detection. The proposed features were designed to be compatible with existing fake news detectors for enhancement.                                                                                                                                          |
| Datasets Used                   | Three real-world datasets, one in English and two in Chinese.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Results/Performance Metrics     | The proposed feature set outperformed state-of-the-art emotional features related to the task and improved the performance of existing fake news detectors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Challenges                      | Existing methods focused only on publisher emotions and did not consider the high-arousal emotions evoked in the crowd (social emotions).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| **Approach/Methodology**        | The research proposed a Domain- and Instance-level Transfer Framework for Fake News Detection (DITFEND). The methodology involved training a general model with data from all domains using a meta-learning perspective for coarse-grained domain-level knowledge transfer. Additionally, fine-grained instance-level knowledge was transferred by training a language model on the target domain to evaluate the transferability of each data instance in source domains and re-weight each instance's contribution. |
| **Datasets Used**               | Two datasets were used for offline experiments, though specific dataset names were not mentioned in the abstract.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Results/Performance Metrics** | Offline experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of DITFEND, and online experiments indicated additional improvements over the base models in a real-world scenario.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Challenges**                  | The abstract mentioned the 'seesaw problem' in multi-domain fake news detection, where improving performance in some domains can hurt the performance of others, resulting in unsatisfactory outcomes for specific domains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| **Approach/Methodology**        | The research introduced a novel reinforcement learning-based model called REinforced Adaptive Learning Fake News Detection (REAL-FND). This model incorporated auxiliary information, such as user comments and user-news interactions, and leveraged both cross-domain and within-domain knowledge to maintain robustness in a target domain, even when trained on a different source domain.                                                                                                                        |
| **Datasets Used**               | Real-world datasets were used, though specific dataset names were not mentioned in the abstract.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Results/Performance Metrics** | Extensive experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of REAL-FND, particularly when limited labeled data was available in the target domain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Challenges**                  | The abstract highlighted the challenge of diverse news domains and the high cost of annotation, which made effective fake news detection non-trivial.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| **Approach/Methodology**        | The research proposed a Memory-guided Multi-view Multi-domain Fake News Detection Framework (M3FEND). This approach modeled news pieces from a multi-view perspective, including semantics, emotion, and style. A Domain Memory Bank was developed to enrich domain information and discover potential domain labels, while a Domain Adapter adaptively aggregated discriminative information from multiple views for multi-domain news detection.                                                                    |

| **Results/Performance Metrics** | Extensive offline experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of M3FEND, and online tests verified its superiority in practice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Challenges**                  | The research identified two main challenges: domain shift (discrepancy among domains in terms of words, emotions, styles, etc.) and domain labeling incompleteness (real-world categorization that outputs a single domain label regardless of topic diversity).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Key Contribution**            | The main contribution was the development of the M3FEND framework, which addressed domain shift and labeling incompleteness by leveraging a multi-view approach and a Domain Memory Bank to enhance cross-domain fake news detection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Approach/Methodology            | The research investigated false news across nine domains on Weibo from 2009 to 2019, analyzing 44,728 posts published by 40,215 users and reposted over 3.4 million times. The study focused on the distribution, spread, and user characteristics associated with false news.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Datasets Used                   | Newly collected Weibo data, comprising 44,728 posts in nine domains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Results/Performance Metrics     | The study observed that false news in daily-life-related domains generated more posts but diffused less effectively than political news, which had the highest diffusion capacity. Widely diffused false news was strongly associated with certain user types and evoked strong emotional responses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Challenges                      | The study highlighted the importance of considering domain characteristics in false news detection systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Key Contribution                | The research provided insights into the patterns of false news diffusion across multiple domains, emphasizing the need for domain-specific approaches in false news detection and the potential for designing improved detection systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Approach/Methodology            | The research proposed a novel model, FuDFEND, which addressed limitations in existing models by introducing a fuzzy inference mechanism. The model utilized a neural network to simulate the fuzzy inference process, constructing a fuzzy domain label for each news item. This label was used by the feature extraction module to capture multi-domain features, which were then fed into a discriminator module to determine if the news was fake.                                                                 |
